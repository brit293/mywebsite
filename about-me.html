            <p class="para">I have designed this webpage as a way to show my coding skills to potential employers, i.e. a coding portfolio, and as a way to tell my story to becoming a developer. My journey to becoming a developer is a long one so please enjoy the ride. This adventure starts with me going to school to pursue my first passion: protecting the environment. This passion led me to get a degree in ecology and to working in the field for about 6 months but the job availability and room for growth just wasnt there so I decided to change directions. So on I went down a winding path to getting an education degree and for many different reasons this path also didnt seem to work out.</p>
            <p class="para">I eventually ended up working for one of the biggest tech and ecommerce companies in the world Amazon.com. I enjoyed working for them but I also knew that what I was doing for them wasnt sustainable long term so I went to my mom and started brainstorming with her as to what I might enjoy doing as a long term career. As we talked she told me how much she enjoys her job as a software engineer because of the puzzles she gets to solve on a daily basis. This was my ah-ha moment.</p>
            <p class="para">I absolutely love puzzles of all types: jigsaws, logics, crosswords, and even rock climbing routes. I am also really good with technology and troubleshooting different things. I then started looking for a way to learn how to code and become a developer; so here I am a newbie and loving it. The other sections of my page will show a more in depth look at all of the different languages I have learned to code in and how I can make use of it. This website will continue to change as I learn more techniques and become a proficient developer.</p>
